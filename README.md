# Selection-Sort

## Introduction: 
This repository contains an implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in C++. Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty, and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

## Features:
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy-to-understand and straightforward C++ code.
- **Detailed Comments**: Includes comments to explain each step of the algorithm.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the nested loops. Suitable for small datasets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as it is an in-place sorting algorithm.
- **Educational Purpose**: Ideal for learning and understanding the basic sorting algorithms.
